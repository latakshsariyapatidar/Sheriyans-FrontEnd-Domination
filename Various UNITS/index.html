    <h1>Learning about various size measuring units</h1>
    <hr />
    <h5>This is used with px units</h5>
    <div id="box-with-px"></div>
    <br>
    <hr />
    <h5>This is used with % units</h5>
    <div id="box-with-percent"></div>
    <br>
    <hr />
    <h5>This is used with vh-vw units</h5>
    <div id="box-with-v"></div>
    <br>
    <hr />
    <h5>This is used with em units</h5>
    <div id="box-with-em"></div>
    <br>
    <hr />
    <h5>This is used with rem units</h5>
    <div id="box-with-rem"></div>

    <p>Finally we can conclude that %, vh-vw, and em are changing their sizes based on chaning the size of windows else every other unit is absolute and does not changes its height or width</p>

    <br>
    <p>Also we could add max/min - height and width which would add a upper and lower limit on the sizes of the elements even though we try to extent them the max/min would hook them on the max/min value which is given by us</p>
